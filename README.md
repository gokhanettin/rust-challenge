# RUST CHALLENGE

## Introduction

I am a big fan of *learn-by-doing*. While I was learning Rust Programming
Language, I decided to solve common computer science problems using the
language, possibly implementing different algorithms for each challenge. This
helps me both keep my general computer science knowledge up-to-date and get the
hang of the language.

## Resources

Challenge resources are

- [METU C Homework Collection][1]
- [HackerRank][2]

Rust resources are

- [The Book][3]
- [Rust by Example][4]
- [Rust for C++ Programmers][5]
